== Introduction

In this tutorial, we show you how to build a demo streaming application with KSQL.  This application continuously computes, in real-time, top music charts based on a stream of song play events.

Does this demo sound familiar?  It should.  Last year Confluent produced a https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/kafka-streams-examples/docs/index.html[similar demo application] using the Kafka Streams API.  Since then, Confluent has released production-ready https://www.confluent.io/product/ksql/[KSQL], the streaming SQL engine for Apache Kafka.  Users can choose between Kafka Streams or KSQL depending on the use case.  Both enable developers to build real-time, scalable, fault-tolerant applications with exactly once capabilities, for Confluent Cloud and on-premises Kafka deployments. Here we take the same music application concept and rewrite it using KSQL so you can compare and contrast the experience.

== Setup

=== Docker

NOTE: This tutorial assumes you are running the KSQL music demo application in Docker. You may alternatively run this demo on a Confluent Platform local install just by running the https://github.com/confluentinc/examples/blob/5.1.0-post/music/start.sh[start script].

Clone this https://github.com/confluentinc/examples[examples repo].

[source,bash]
